# Murakami
## Chicago Fiery Skippers 2016 Phase 3 Group Project
Murakami was created by Alex Wen, Elizabeth Alexander, Jack Thatcher, and Frank Lam. 

### Purpose
Murakami is a virtual book club mobile app that allows readers to share reactions and discuss books they are reading. We felt that many readers are missing an outlet to discuss their thoughts and feelings, and Murakami can serve as a platform to encourage open exchange as well as find more books to read.

If you'd like to get a feel for the app, check out this brief [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12g0svkhGruGdiqkC3sd_LsFFIvLaaCkVBYFeS0GFujk/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000). The team is in the process of perfecting the app so that we can make it available for public download. Until then, the only way to experience the app is to download our code and deploy to your local machine, or checkout the slideshow.
